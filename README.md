## About
This is an old project that was recently resurrected and updated to use the most recent version of Vue and Webpack. The old version is the in the "old" branch, of course.

Here are some interesting differences and comparisons between the two versions:

|Repo         |Vue Version |Webpack Version  |Build Time  |Build Size |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
|old          |2.3.3       |2.6.1            |6407ms      |3.08 MB    |
|master       |2.5.17      |4.18.0           |3338ms      |2.37 MB    |

Even with such a small build, the new version gets built 48% faster and is 23% smaller.
